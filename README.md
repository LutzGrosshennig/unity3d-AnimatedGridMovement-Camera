# An animated "Dungeon Master" / "Legend of Grimrock" / "Eye of the Beholder" style camera.

An animated camera control script that gives you "Dungeon Master"/"Xenomorph"/"Legend of Grimrock" style WSADQE control in your Unity3D game.

I am a huge fan of the old Amiga game **'Xenomorph'** back from the nineties. So I decided to start a similar SciFi themed game (working title 'Xenomorph 2409')

Of course I need similar movement/rotation then thoose games so I started writting this script. 

# Usage

* Attach the script as a component to your main camera.
* Adjust the grid size to meet your grid.
* Adjust the rotation speed multiplier to your liking.

# The controls
* 'W' Moves you 1 cell forward
* 'S' Moves you 1 cell backward
* 'A' Strafe left 1 cell
* 'D' Strafe right 1 cell
* 'Q' Turn left 90°
* 'E' Turn right 90°

# MEW! Free look mode

Press the right mouse button to enter a free look mode where you can look round without a grid restriction.
Releasing the mouse button will put you back in movement mode.

# What it looks like in action
You can watch a work in progress version of "Xenomorph 2409" on YouTube:

</div>

# Planned improvements

You may want to check out a new and more advanced version of the script https://github.com/LutzGrosshennig/unity3d-advanced-grid-movement

Since this version is much simpler to understand I will leave it as it is.

Have fun, Lutz
