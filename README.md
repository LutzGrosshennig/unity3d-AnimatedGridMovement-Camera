# An animated "Dungeon Master" / "Legend of Grimrock" / "Eye of the Beholder style camera.

An animated camera control script that gives you "Dungeon Master"/"Xenomorph"/"Legend of Grimrock" style WSADQE control in your Unity3D game.

I am a huge fan of the old Amiga game **'Xenomorph'** back from the nineties. So I decided to start a similar SciFi themed game (working title 'Xenomorphs')

Of course I need similar movement/rotation then thoose games so I started writting this script. 

# The controls
* 'W' Moves you 1 cell forward
* 'S' Moves you 1 cell backward
* 'A' Strafe left
* 'D' Strafe right
* 'Q' Turn left 90°
* 'E' Turn right 90°

# What it looks like in action
You can watch a work in progress version of "Xenomorphs" on Youtube:

# Not (yet) included as they are part of the prototype
* Unittests (the whole thing was written TDD style)
* Collision detection
* Recoil animation when you try to run into a wall.


Have fun, Lutz
